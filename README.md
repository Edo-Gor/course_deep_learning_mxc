# Deep learning

## Repository description

This repository contains code related to the Deep Learning course by Mike X. Cohen on Udemy:

[A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro)](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning_x)

The majority of the "base" code is adapted from material developed by the course instructor. I have made minor modifications to experiment with it.

The exercises in the "code challenge" and "project" files contain more of my own contributions, where I added creative input beyond the provided material.

If you are exploring this repository out of an interest in deep learning, the course itself is highly recommend; it is a great resource that provides both solid theoretical and practical foundations.
